The Machine Learning Reading Group (MLRG) aims at enhancing our understanding in broad areas of machine learning (ML), incubating innovative ideas, and fostering cross-domain research collaborations. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, robustness, causal inference, game-theoretic learning, collaborative/cooperative learning, economics, etc. 

- **Date/Time**: Bi-weekly on Tuesday, 13:30pm-15:00pm
- **Location**: CISPA-C0 Room 2.01 & [Zoom](https://cispa-de.zoom.us/j/67376706036)

Each session is led by a presenter(s) who presents a paper of their choice and leads the discussion. The participants are encouraged to read the paper beforehand.

The MLRG is hosted by the scientific group Muandet at [CISPA--Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) and is open to everyone. If you are interested in presenting a paper at the reading group, please contact the organiser.
