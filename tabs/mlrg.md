The Machine Learning Reading Group (MLRG) aims at enhancing our understanding in broad areas of machine learning (ML), incubating innovative ideas, and fostering cross-domain research collaborations. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, learning theory, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, robustness, causal inference, game-theoretic learning, collaborative/cooperative learning, economics, etc. 

*Update*: From 01 November 2023 onwards, the MLRG will be cohosted with the [Machine Learning Group from University of Saarland](https://machinelearning.uni-saarland.de/). Further details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtgEezBqS4d_ACPt-emK2NT52x7nofX9jxgH1N04MQE/edit#gid=845612096). 

- **Date/Time**: Bi-weekly on Wednesday, 14:30pm-16:00pm
- **Location**: Alternating between CISPA building and MPI building. You can also join [virtually](https://cs-uni-saarland-de.zoom.us/j/91937148099?pwd=R1BhUVVVMXJKRWU1OXI5alBjWERBdz09#success).
- **Organiser**: Siu Lun Chau (siu-lun.chau-at-cispa.de), Huynh Quang Kiet Vo (huvo00001@stud.uni-saarland.de)

Each session is led by a presenter(s) who presents a paper of their choice and leads the discussion. The participants are encouraged to read the paper beforehand. To stay informed, please sign up to our [mailing list](https://lists.saarland-informatics-campus.de/postorius/lists/ml-reading-group.lists.saarland-informatics-campus.de/).
