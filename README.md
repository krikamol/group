# Welcome

The groupâ€™s research aims at understanding the principles that enable autonomous agents to learn from past experience and interact successfully with complex environments, and to use this understanding to design new learning algorithms. The research theme spans the following areas:

1. **Prediction**: How do we design ML algorithms that can cope with distributional shifts? The topics of interest are domain adaption (DA), domain generalization (DG), out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and robustness. Kernel methods, kernel mean embedding of distributions, and applications thereof are our mathematical arsenal to tackle these problems.

2. **Causation**: How do we leverage cause-effect relationships in improving ML models, and conversely how do we use sophisticated ML methods to aid causal inference in complex environments? Topics of interest are observational studies, unobserved confounders in causal inference, spurious correlation in machine learning, distributional treatment effects, counterfactual inference, and algorithmic decision making. Natural experiments and quasi-experimental designs such as instrumental variable (IV), proxy variables, and regression discontinuity design (RDD) offers tools to address these problems.

3. **Regulation**: How do we regulate the deployment of ML models in heterogeneous environments to ensure the democratic use of AI? Topics of interest are feedback loops and strategic behaviour. To gain a better understanding of these problems, we will be adopting techniques from algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, social choice theory and other related sub-fields of economics.
