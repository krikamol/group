# Machine Learning Reading Group

The Machine Learning Reading Group (MLRG) aims to enhance our understanding in broad areas of machine learning (ML), especially out-of-domain generalisation and adaptation, causal inference and econometrics, collaborative learning of multiple agents, and other interesting machine learning topics.

A person will present a paper of their choice and lead the discussion. Other participants are encouraged but not compulsory to read the paper beforehand.

The MLRG is initially hosted by the scientific group Muandet at [CISPA--Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en). If you are interested in presenting a paper at the reading group, please contact the organiser.
