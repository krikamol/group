[Jake Fawkes](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/fawkes/) and [Shahine Bouabid](https://shahineb.github.io/) from the University of Oxford and [Renan Gadoni](https://techlaw.uottawa.ca/people/gadoni-renan) from the University of Ottawa join our group as research interns. Their internships are financially supported by the Helmholtz Information and Data Science Academy (HIDA). 

Jake's research centers on causal machine learning with a focus on causal inference for fairness, while Shahine is interested in developing simple and interpretable statistical machine learning methodologies to address challenges that arise in climate science. On the other hand, Renan is pursuing his Ph.D. in Law at the University of Ottawa Centre for Law, Technology and Society. He is interested in the field of governance of data as well as emerging issues around AI regulations. 

Welcome, Jake, Shahine, and Renan. We look forward to our fruitful collaboration.
