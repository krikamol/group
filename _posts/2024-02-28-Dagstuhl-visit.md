This year, we participated in the Dagstuhl Seminar on AI for Social Good, where we shared the latest advancements in AI research with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to enhance their operations. During the seminar, we addressed the challenges NGOs encounter when adapting to AI technologies and discussed the potential risks associated with their implementation.
