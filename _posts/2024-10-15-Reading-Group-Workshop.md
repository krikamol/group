The Rational Intelligence Lab and Machine Learning Lab at Saarland University had a joint workshop for their reading group. The workshop had talks from Krik and Isabel about the themes of their research groups on Rational Intelligence and Socially-Aware ML respectively. There were also talks from the postdocs of both the groups, presenting their research on topics of Epistemology in AI, Causality and Robustness. Attendies had discussions about topic series in the reading group and the future collaborations in research.
