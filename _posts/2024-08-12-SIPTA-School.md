Our group members including Anurag, Alan, and Krikamol, participated in the week-long [SIPTA School on Imprecise Probabilities](https://school24.sipta.org/) which took place from Monday 12 to Friday 16 August 2024. The school was organized by the [Society for Imprecise Probabilities: Theories and Applicationsand (SIPTA)](https://sipta.org/) and provided the participants with the opportunity to get introduced to the basics of various topics in this theory, both theoretical and applied to different disciplines, by leading experts in the field. 

Probability theory is a fundamental building block of statistical inference and machine learning, but there is more to uncertainty than what probability theory alone can capture. This is why we participated in this summer school.
