Kiet presented our work [Causal Strategic Learning with Competitive Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16262) at AAAI-24:

Kiet talked about how we study the competitive agent selection problem under strategic responses utilising a causal framework.  We show that without third-party regulation, decision makers could face a trade-off between incentivising improvements or being unjustly biased towards selecting performant agents. To address this, we provide a cooperative protocol and causal learning procedure, offering new approaches to navigate these challenges!
