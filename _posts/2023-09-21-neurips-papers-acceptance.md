We will present 2 papers at [Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023) this year.

- [A Measure-Theoretic Axiomatisation of Causality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17139) (Oral)
- [Explaining the Uncertain: Stochastic Shapley Values for Gaussian Process Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15167) (Spotlight)

The first paper is led by our Ph.D. student, [Junhyung Park](https://junhyung-park.github.io/), while the second is led by our postdoc, [Siu Lun Chau](https://chau999.github.io/). Many congratulations to everyone involved in the projects.
