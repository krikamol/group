Last week, our postdoc Siu Lun Chau had the privilege of presenting his research on stochastic explanations at the Oxford Man Institute, ETH AI Center, and the Department of Management, Technology, and Economics at ETH Zurich. 
He engaged in enriching discussions with theoretical GP researchers and applied health informatics researchers
about the benefits of integrating uncertainty into explanations for building trustworthy machine learning applications.
