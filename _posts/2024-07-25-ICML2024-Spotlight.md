Our group members including Anurag, Alan, and Krikamol, presented their spotlight paper titled [Domain Generalisation via Imprecise Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04669) at the forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024) which took place in the beautiful city of Vienna, Austria. 

As you can see, our poster is as hot as the weather there!
